So by owning both cars I have experienced both brands. I’ve been driving a honda city AT for almost 7 years and have never faced any challenge whatsoever with the car. The only major expenses include Two sets of tyres, Insurance And fuel. The car has done over 110k and still drives like a dream. Toyota on the other hand being twice as expensive feels like a premium car and is rock solid trouble free, worry free car. The biggest expense here was insurance. This one has done 25k and feels like We bought it yesterday. In terms of comfort Toyota is far superior than any car in the industry be it the driver or the passengers there is no match for Innova. Honda city on the other hand is superb in driving. It’s steering is so light that anyone can drive it with ease. There is no engine sound at idling. Super smooth ride and you reach in comfort to your destination. Long drives for the passengers is not as good as Innova though. Overall to sum up both are amazing brands super reliable, great resale value for both brands. Service cost is comparable to any car in the segment. To decide between one of the two is a difficult decision as both the brands are of amazing quality.",https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/toyota-vs-honda-which-make-right-car,"In terms of sheer corporate value, Toyota is the most successful, preponderant automaker in the world.

But, while Motorola phones had great value and software support, it has declined in the last few years after its acquisition by Lenovo. It isn't the Motorola we used to love. Nokia on the other hand is growing significantly by making good promises and delivering them as well. TL;DR : Nokia has phones with better price value and better software support(almost all Nokia phones are under android one or android go program promising 2 years of major updates). Motorola may have better customer support. I'd personally suggest that you go for Nokia. It's future seems bright.",https://www.quora.com/Which-brand-or-company-is-best-Motorola-or-Nokia,"Well, it depends what you expect from a phone. If you want good build quality and regular software updates do not ever think of buy a phone of Chinese or Chinese-owned brand (except the phones running on Android One). If you have a tight budget, then you can proceed with Moto. Since Nokia’s phone are a bit overpriced, you may get one at reasonable price during sales. Also, the Nokia-exclusive Zeiss optics don’t have any competitor in their price range. If you want a Moto X4, then Nokia 7 Plus is always ahead. But if you want G5S Plus, then go on with it because Nokia 2.1 or 3.1 are the only available phones from Nokia and have a bit low specs. However you can go on for Nokia 6.1 or 6.1 Plus over Moto G6 because of their build quality and stock software anlog with regular updates and security patches.",https://www.quora.com/Which-brand-or-company-is-best-Motorola-or-Nokia,Motorola is best .Its always a branded better than China because the performance of branded will be good when compared with China ( Nokia).As now Nokia brand is different which we had used earlier.Now Nokia is designed by China and manufactured by China.They are taking the name of Nokia and giving some money for using it,,,,

If you want to buy Samsung phone than you should go for only S series or Note series or higher versions of A series. Because this three are good.

compsci,Javascript,PHP,https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/php-vs-javascript/,"In the PHP vs. JavaScript discussion, it is important to start by identifying that JavaScript is mostly a frontend language, while PHP is strictly backend. It is not fair to compare one language for backend with another for frontend development. However, ever since the release of Node.js, JavaScript became capable of serving both client-side and server-side purposes. Therefore, it becomes possible to draw some conclusions for people considering which language to learn.",https://www.quora.com/Is-PHP-better-than-JavaScript,"I would normally say “it depends” for a question like this, but… JavaScript and Node.js are rising stars. PHP is in a nose dive. JavaScript has professional engineering quality static types support in TypeScript. PHP has optional types with about a tenth the power. Node.js is event driven, and as such is better for real time connections in that a single server can support hundreds of thousands of connections where PHP would fall over much sooner. About the only thing that can be said in favor of PHP is that you can get cheap hosting. But considering you can get free hosting for cloud functions on AWS Lambda, that's not much of an advantage any more. You use PHP when you have to (WordPress plugins, existing Laravel backend, etc.). Anyone starting a new project in PHP today is guilty of gross negligence. Learn a better ecosystem. It's worth it.",https://www.quora.com/Is-PHP-better-than-JavaScript,"PHP is generally easier for people to learn since it is pretty standard C-based imperative language. JavaScript, on the other hand, is asynchronous and based in callbacks along with more modern flow control constructs like Promises. JavaScript has a broader set of environments it can run in, namely the browser, the server as well as on mobile devices. PHP is limited to the server. PHP has a wider install base, it's estimated that 80%+ of the internet (note that this depends heavily on how you count) runs on it. JavaScript is being developed more quickly with new language features being added constantly where PHP is a lot slower.",,,,
compsci,Perl,Ruby,https://www.educba.com/perl-vs-ruby/,Perl is an ideal choice for system administration work as well as the web development task whereas Ruby is highly suitable for the traffic-heavy application. ... Perl 5 is less Object-Oriented although Perl 6 has a very good Object-Oriented support whereas Ruby is highly Object-Oriented language.,https://www.quora.com/As-someone-who-knows-Ruby-is-it-worth-to-learn-Perl,"I know a lot more Ruby than Perl, but the primary contrast is :Perl code is much terser than Ruby
If you want terse code that does its job in the least number of lines, Perl is better. If you want expressive, almost poetic and much more generally readable code, and don't mind the cost of a few extra characters, Ruby is much better. This manifests itself in several ways in practice:
- Perl One liners (one line perl commands that perform batch manipulation:  of a bunch of files, for instance) are a cult in themselves - see Perl One Liners to get a feel.
- Perl is better suited if the primary task is regex - Ruby regex syntax itself is pretty good, arguably close to Perl, but the typical use cases of doing text pattern matching with regexes are better expressed in Perl, in my view. Many developers do regexes with grep, and a natural progression for more complex manipulation not supported by grep is either through sed or awk for a class of tasks, or for more general power, to use Perl.
- Perl is used on the command line or with very short batch scripts much more effectively than Ruby, which usually involves longer scripts. So, bottom line, if you do mostly text manipulation and matching, and want quick solutions on the command line or with short scripts, Perl is definitely worth learning in addition to Ruby. If not, perhaps not :-)",https://www.coursereport.com/blog/ruby-vs-python-choosing-your-first-programming-language#rubyvspython,https://www.quora.com/As-someone-who-knows-Ruby-is-it-worth-to-learn-Perl,,,,
compsci,Apple,Intel,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-choose-a-job-at-Apple-or-Intel,"Intel. Apple is doing some exciting things in hardware right now, but it all honesty its kind of a sweatshop if you're at the bottom rung as a physical designer or RTL developer, which is what I assume you'd be. The reporting ratios are very high - your manager will rarely talk to you - and they ruthlessly measure performance and cull underperformers. You also have very little influence. Functional teams have zero product input, because product definition is taken care of entirely separately. And other parts of the organization have basically defined how you will do your job. The hardware organization is very new - until quite recently, none of the actual chip development was done in-house - so career paths are ill-defined. At a more senior level, if you could join as a PD manager or a CAD manager (which are highly technical roles), I'd choose Apple but as a new graduate its not likely to be the best for your career development. Intel on the other hand, while regimented and hierarchical, has a longstanding culture of caring deeply about their employees career development. Among other things, if you join as a engineer, you can change jobs to anywhere else in the organization after a few years, the only condition being you have to stick with the decision for a while. This is a huge deal. Apple will not let you do that. Also, in Intel's culture, whatever you are asked to do is something considered to be new - if they already knew how to do it, they would have automated it. And then you get to define how to do it. The difference in seniority is simply the size of the problem you get given. This is very different from Apple, where in all likelihood what you get asked to do is implement something that was implemented before at a different process.",https://www.quora.com/Should-I-choose-a-job-at-Apple-or-Intel,"If the offers are even close, you will live much better in the greater Portland area than in or near Cupertino, so money-wise Intel probably is a better offer. And, although it doesn't seem it, that $10k extra in your pocket each year matters fresh-out-of-school because you will need to be working a lot, so home/life problems you would solve yourself you will now need to solve with money. It's probably more than $10k as Intel will contribute to your 401k whether you put any money in or not, so you don't need to put money aside for that.

jbt,aluminum,steel,https://www.quora.com/Whats-strongest-steel-or-aluminium,"Steel is stronger as a material per unit of cross-sectional area. However, steel is also heavier than aluminum per unit volume by a factor. In boat building we use the rule of thumb that aluminum is about 1/2 the strength of steel at 1/3 the weight. Which means that generally we can build an aluminum vessel at a given strength at 2/3 the weight of an “equivalent” steel vessel. Keep in mind that often the limiting factor in a structure is its rigidity and that, by the time you achieve sufficient structural rigidity, you have more than sufficient strength. Because aluminum is less dense than steel, and because structural rigidity is as much a function of shape as material strength, it is therefore often possible to achieve sufficient structural rigidity in aluminum at 1/2 the weight of a “comparable” steel structure.",https://eagle-aluminum.com/steel-vs-aluminum/,"On comparing the overall strength of steel vs aluminum, there is not a clear and simple answer. This is because, while steel is technically stronger than aluminum, aluminum is often much lighter, so you have to take into consideration the weight to strength ratio. However, in focusing just on shear strength, steel has a high amount of carbon contributing to its general strength advantage. Also important to take into account when comparing the strength of steel vs aluminum is malleability. Aluminum is much more malleable than steel, meaning it can be successfully bent or extruded into a variety of custom shapes or profiles without suffering breaks or cracks. Aluminum is also known to be very ductile, enabling it to be stretched without breaking. Aluminum extrusions can be made as strong as needed for most applications. Cold-weather applications are well-served by aluminum because as the temperatures fall, aluminum actually becomes stronger.",https://eagle-aluminum.com/steel-vs-aluminum/,"Great heat conductor: aluminum is one of the best metals for conducting heat, far better than stainless steel, in fact.

The easily available (in the US) commercial beers wouldn’t be up to the job though. First off the alcohol is too high, even the 3.2% beers aren’t something you want to be drinking all day every day. So, I think i’d start brewing my own small beers with only .25-.75% ABV. From there, you can use acid fermentation to make some mildly tart beers, add tea or coffee to the wort if you’d like a bit of caffeine, and you can change or add anything you want to create the perfect beer for the occasion.
