      "Like all good questions, the answer depends. It depends on your application: Is it something you are likely going to be using periodically? A lot on some days of every month and very little the rest of the month? Once a year? Then a pay-as-you-go model would be 'nicer'.  It also depends on the sophistication of your users. Will they bother to do the mental arithmetic if you explain the PAYG model to them? Will they care?  How much will your users be spending? $5? $10? They might simple not care for that amount of money to optimize their experience and would probably rather go for something that is simple or easy.   Could the two models make a differences as large as $1000? Then you might find people are more than willing to have a look at the PAYG terms...  \n",

      "I suggest learning both, Haskell first, then Common Lisp. My experience with Haskell was that the static typing seemed to be a restricting annoyance at first, but once I got used to it, I noticed that most of my type errors had logic errors hiding behind them. When you get to this point, and the next milestone, which is learning to think in types and define your own types as a means of expressing your solution, you'll be ready for Common Lisp.   With Common Lisp, you can add monads, currying, and everything you liked from Haskell, but you also get multiple inheritance like Frank Shearar mentioned, and generic functions with multiple dispatch, and an advanced exception handling system.   So why not just learn Common Lisp first? Coming from a procedural and OOP background, my experience has been that I didn't really understand functional programming until I had to use it exclusively. Once functional programming is comfortable, you can add the rest of the tools that Common Lisp makes available, and use whatever tool is best at the task at hand.   \n",

      "You want to do all set-based operations in the database for performance reasons. So aggregation functions, sorting functions, joins etc.   This age calculation, I'd do in code. The only reason I might ever do something like this in a database query is if it required lots of columns that I wouldn't otherwise select that could actually amount to enough data to meaningfully slow down my query. Selecting a few integer values will not make a meaningful performance difference. And even if it makes a moderate performance difference I will be biased towards keeping this logic in the application code.  \n",

      "Specialise if you enjoy it  As you are aware, if you specialise you are automatically incurring an opportunity cost in that you won't be immediably eligible for other technologies (e.g. Java programmers don't often immediately get accepted for compiler optimisation jobs). However, you have to balance this with your love of the complexity inherent in your chosen discipline.   You say you want to be an expert - well go ahead and take the time to learn your chosen discipline. We as a community always need new experts. However, my advice is to follow the pragmatic programmer recommendation of \"Learn a new language every year\". That way, while you're engaging in deep lexical analysis of algorithmic encoding, you can also be churning out a little iPhone app that interests you on the side. You never know, the cross pollenation of different paradigms may cause you some insight that will extend your specialisation into new areas.  \n",

      "Unfortunately, those are both myths. SDEs and SDETs get the same starting salary, so it would be silly to have a lower bar for one of the positions. You'll have to code at the whiteboard in both interviews and show that you can deconstruct complex problems.  Depending on the group, the SDE loop may have more emphasis on algorithms, and on the SDET side, you'll find more emphasis on systems thinking - but the emphasis can vary slightly from group to group.  To prepare, study algorithms and implementation examples, but more importantly practice solving random programming problems on paper (or on a whiteboard if you have one). Be able to think out loud while you code (the answer is often not as important as the thought process). Also have examples to share on how you learn, communication, and dealing with conflict.  For an SDET interview, you can read my book (more importantly, the book will help you evaluate if you want to be an SDET. On the dev side, you can goo...bing \"Microsoft Interview Questions\" and probably get some good practice material - but skip the \"why are manhole covers round\" type questions, as those are rarely used anymore.  \n"
