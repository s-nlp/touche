199	today's pressure cookers are built with multiple safety features that ensure that cooks won't have the same explosion issues as in pressure cooker lore of yesterday.
200	they should never be stored in a drawer with other (steel) knives. though some manufacturers say their ceramic knives can be washed in a dishwasher, most recommend hand washing and i agree. no, ceramic knives will never fully replace your traditional steel kitchen knives.
201	ceramic knives are very different than steel knives in handling as well as function and they should be used only for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats.
202	i purchased a few months ago at sam's a set of forever sharp knives (6 knives and 2 juicers plus 2 sets of steak knives. just noticed that one of the large knives and a pearing knife are showing signs of rust. what should i do? * bread knives - what kind of knife is best for slicing bread?
203	i'd recommend this sharpener for anyone who likes to keep a variety of knives in top condition or finds it difficult to use a steel or manual sharpeners.
204	i was very surprised at how comfortable these handles actually are and they're not slippery when wet. blades are quality forged steel, extremely sharp with full tang. all knives except one utility knife, have fine straight edges, including the steak knives.
205	now i know what many of you are thinking...hey, rob- i have one and it was super sharp, the sharpest i've ever seen, smart guy! be that as it may, it ain't the sharpest i've ever seen! tool steel, carbon steel and the best stainless steel knives will get much sharper than the ceramics you buy.
206	the part about the folding steel or doing it so well, makes a knife with good retention, in general isn't true. the steel in japanese knives is harder then those typically found in european knives. a hard knife, made out of steel or ceramic will chip.
207	should mention that i have salvaged badly rusted carbon steel pans. if all the rust is removed and the pan seasoned properly, the remaining pitting doesn't hurt the non-stickiness of the pan at all.
208	discuss cooking - cooking forums > general cooking information > cookware and accessories > knives i agree. buy the tojiro, save the money, and use it to buy an edgepro. after reading all the warranty policies from individual j-knife companies i still decided on the tojiro knives.
209	if the steel can be sharpened to a great edge, i don't care what the steel is composed of. i also want the handle to fit my hand. my hand is pretty big and there are plenty of expensive knives that just seem to to small. so my suggestion is to try a few, find the ones you like, and buy those.
210	as someone who is guilty of not sharpening (or should i say ‘honing’) our knives regularly enough, you’ve just motivated me to do something about it. there’s another job for this evening. when i worked in a professional kitchen, i used the steel every day before using any knife for work.
211	as time passed and my knowledge and wallet expanded, i was able to buy higher quality knives that were better suited to the intended tasks. due to this acquired experience, i decided to open this web site to offer good quality knives at reasonable prices.
212	we accomplish this finish by tumbling the blades in an aggressive ceramic media. these ceramic stones polish the blade in every direction possible giving the surface a non-reflective or glazed appearance.
213	"i joined knife rights to support the great job they are doing; you should too!"" ""i can't think of a more fundamentally useful, basic tool in existence today than a good quality knife."" ""i whole-heartedly endorse the work of knife rights and support their mission!"
214	hand wash and dry after every use. * regularly sharpen the knife using a whetstone or ceramic. a sharpening steel is not recommended (note from paul: i've used a steel on mine; with a light touch and minimal swipes, i find it resets the edge just fine.
215	"maintenance/sharpening: for everyday maintenance i recommend the 10"" fine ceramic hone (rod) which when used regularly (every day for heavy use, or at least once a week for light/occasional home use) will easily keep your knife sharp for a year or more."
216	ideal for resharpening japanese knives which are no longer responding to a fine hone, or for maintaining german or other european style knives. works much like a regular butcher steel.
217	i should start with a disclaimer, though: i haven't compared it with hundreds of other knives. it would be interesting, in particular, to live with this knife and the ux-10 for a few months, to see what differences appear. also, i'm using this knife at home.
218	as with all sakai takayuki knives, i find the fit and finish and overall quality excellent, and the edge is very, very sharp and precisely ground and finished. made of hard and long lasting special alloy stainless steel from uddeholm sweden.
219	"it's the idea size for home use, and many pros are now using 8"" knives too, so it's not out of the question for a working chef or culinary school student."
220	the finish is kuro-uchi (black) with a lacquer coating -- this helps protect the steel and should not be polished off. edge is 50/50 bevel, so it is fine for left or right-handed use, and is easily sharpened with any stone or hone or gadget suitable for japanese knives.
221	or you're expected to bargain with some sales clerk or owner (which i hate doing) just to get what should be a fair and clearly posted price to begin with.
222	this is the smoothest most people will ever need to use for most average knives, especially german (henckels, wusthof, victorinox, sanelli, etc.) knives or any knife with standard steel.
223	most potters and ceramic artists i know seem to have boxes of tools selected or made for specific processes of surface enrichment. they invariably are seeking the one tool that will out-perform all others, feel better in the hand or just be more pleasurable in use.
224	* will ceramic scissors shatter or break if i drop them? * what are the uses for different knives and kitchen tools? these knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia). zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert.

226	but 24 years later i am still using them and i get them professionally sharpened every two or three years. so ask youself if you want to save money now or not have to buy new knives every few years.
227	boker and kyocera make knives from this type of ceramic. kevin mcclungcame out with a ceramic composite knife blade that much tougher than the previous ceramics, tough enough to actually be useful as a knife blade for most jobs.
228	using what i call the better angle choice zdp is a very good steel imo. i will say that i never got the chipping on any other steel i’ve used like i did with zdp-189. of the knives i have now my favorite steel is cpm-s30v and cpm-m4.

233	"""i also teach how to buy a knife and what are the essentials, and where do you go from there."" sarah jay, who penned ""knives cooks love,"" says there's a big misconception retailers should address: many home chefs incorrectly believe a honing steel can sharpen dull knives."
234	it is hardly all-encompassing, many new knives are too wild and impractical to meet my criteria for a functional and practical wilderness survival knife. for the most part, i have not included tactical or martial arts knives.
235	this is one of those forehead slapping, why-didn't-i-think-of-this concepts. a 9.45 inch (240 mm) long ceramic rod is inserted into a wood base a few inches square. the kit comes with 2 ceramic rods, fine and course. 
236	which should give you an idea regarding the availability and market price of the old busse blades, infi or not. although, this one is infi steel. not that the new ones are easy to get, but everything is relative, thus the new blades can be considered as easy to get.
237	i got it together with another kitchen knives, and it was a lucky buy as it turned out later. i'll describe details below. - rosle's crosswise peeler is well designed and made tool. sturdy, pretty versatile for a peeler. majority of the peelers i've seen so far are much worse.
238	personally, i wouldn't buy it, only because vg-10 steel is of no interest to me, i got one vg-10 steel paring knife already, tojiro flash, which is a little harder than the shun parer, plus a few other small knives, like watanabe ko-deba knife and watanabe kamagata paring knife from shirogami i steel
239	then, one day friend of mine asked to sharpen a few kitchen knives for him, and as usual i view that as an opportunity to a) practice my sharpening skills; b) evaluate and play with the knives i wouldn't buy myself and review them. so, that's how the very first calphalon knife ended up in my hands.
240	in my opinion they're the good guys :) back their warranty, provide objective data regarding their knives and testing them and so on. once i was out to buy kitchen knives one of the choices i've had to make was to stick to global knives only, or to try other things as well.
241	nothing interesting or different to speak of. the steel used in the wusthof santoku is the good old x50crmov15 stainless steel, used in majority of mid/high range western kitchen knives. i've commented on that steel quite a bit in kitchen knife steel faq and other reviews.
242	i didn't buy it though.
243	they are made from carbon steel, stainless steel, stamped steel ceramic or even plastic. the better knives are balanced so as they are being used they do not feel awkward. by awkward i mean they feel heavy or light at the pointed end. proper balance eases the strain on the user.

722	the show is about the simpsons is based on the form, or better post-sitcom format is composed of blue-collar reagan poor family, about rosanne and married with children.
723	this show is a hundred percent better than family guy. if you think the simpsons are getting boring just watch family guy. the simpsons will rise up again and destroy family guy for the garbage that it is. long live the simpsons.
724	it had futurama, the pj’s, i think a simpsons repeat and i’m not sure if the 4th show was family guy or king of the hill. i’am a fan of all the animation domination shows not just the simpsons and i’m not bias. everyone has the right to a opinion.
725	the object here is not for the actors to pay personally for the reduction. the cost is that the cast is a component of the show, all of which is being downsized to do a final season. wow, this just got real. one more season, tv is losing something special that’s for sure. 
726	i don’t think that f.g. is bad show (although i don’t like kind of art, or the way gags are presented in show), but i surely like simpsons much, much more, and i can say that i’m really proud on the simpsons when i see that their ratings are better than family guys.
727	i think these ratings will be a sign to come that the simpsons dominance on sundays is over. family guy was freakin hilarious and even the cleavland show was better! time for simpsons writers to man up and produce some quality episodes before we loose complete interest. honestly, i expected more.
728	i wouldn’t be surprised if family guy got canceled any time soon. it’s too bad the ratings are not very high. i thought “in the name of the grandfather” was by far the best of the hd episodes so far. i’ll be the first to admit: this was better than i thought it was gonna be!
729	i grew up with the simpsons in my life. there is something incredible about the humour and heart the simpsons has that has inspired me to become a better person as i grew up. the simpsons can make me cry tears of laughter, or it can just make me cry tears.

736	i have to admit that unlike last years’ family guy disaster, the simpsons trans cameo was far from monstrous, but it wasn’t anything to cheer about. (note: you think its a coincidence that that one women looks like winne from the kinsy sicks?)
737	family guy has moments where it is hilarious but they leap out unexpectedly in the midst of something which is patently a wannabe of the simpsons, except wackier and not as clever. since there are already about a million episodes of the simpsons, a knock-off isn't going to get anyone excited.
738	"is it okay to call someone ""black"" or african-american? is there a difference? do you believe that the actions of our (black) peers help or hinder us in the sense of our own identity? is ""the man"" really the system, a white guy, or both? how has he put you down? is that your fault?"
739	the biggest redeeming feature of this game is the on-line play and the multiplay elements, which i found fun, but don't bother if you want to play on your own. the simpsons arcade game is a nice harks back to a bygone era, the repetitive music, easy gameplay and bright graphics.
740	also, most audiences who watch shows like that don't care as much about the quality and character development, which fox has shown by bringing back family guy instead of futurama because it got better re-run ratings and more dvd sales.
741	the start of the game offers the choice of the four, non-maggie members of the simpsons’ immediate family. none of the characters are any better or worse than the others — pick which one you like the most, or you find has the least annoying voice.

986	this is why my blogpoll ballot looked very different from the lebowski rankings.
987	because oregon is a far, far better team than k.s.u., a 39-7 home loss to the ducks, while quite bad, isn't nearly as shameful as texas's loss to the wildcats.
988	it proves that our sport has a fickle nature and that we're much better off looking at the entire body-of-work of a team than judging them off a single performance. if we assume that florida was the better overall team that year, does this mean that the best team does not always win?

1000	the incredible hulk definitely lives up to his name. his level of strength, endurance and healing ability is determined by his emotional state. or to put it more simply, the madder hulk gets, the stronger hulk gets.
1001	"my big question is, will we finally get to hear those immortal words, ""hulk smash!""? this is either the greatest news ever.... or the worste news in the world....."
1002	many wrongly think that just because hulk is bigger and looks stronger than it means he is stronger. superman can move planets...need i say more! others believe hulk would win because they're likely marvel fan boys.
1003	he exists on pure anger and he gets stronger the more angry he gets, or at least that’s the most accurate rendition of the character. he’s been brilliant in the past and he’s been gray and red, but the real hulk is a giant green monster.
1004	he’s much stronger when he stays grounded in the concrete elements of the story.
1005	the seven each have one or more unusual powers, but their father dotes on number one, who is a superman-like figure, and denegrates the others.
1006	who has superman fought before? beats me. maybe offshoots or other instances of the ship – if it’s a machine who says there has to be only one? the issue has a fun interlude in which the daily planet staff has a meeting.

1020	she and smith seem to have genuine chemistry, and i’m glad that if the doctor had to have a wife or something similar, it’s a woman who’s as suitably larger-than-life as he is. although the main mystery is never solved and the real villain, if there is one, is never revealed, who cares? 
1021	is there any reason why you didn’t put in superman or spiderman? i feel your pain tim. i also don’t have a huge comic book group of friends. i just have to go with the flow. the reason characters like superman or spider man are not included is basically that this is a fighting tournament.

1032	i really enjoyed both superman and the legion of superheroes and final crisis: legion of three worlds, so i asked a friend who was more knowledgeable about the legion for some recommendations.
1033	like superman he flies and is super-strong and invulnerable. his costume is red and yellow.
1034	"even the title, ""the hulk vs. the thing,"" bears that out--perhaps meaning to let fans know that this battle would at last contain the answer to who was stronger, once and for all. and that it does."
1035	mountainous in stature and covered in hard, orange rock, ben grimm, manhattan native, can punch his way through steel just as easily as his contemporaries: 'the hulk', juggernaut, hercules or superman.
1036	bell, who narrates the film in the jocular first-person style of michael moore or morgan spurlock, reflects on steroid use as a metaphor for modern american life. are steroids un-american, as senator joseph r. biden jr. is heard to say? or are they as american as apple pie?
1037	superman would beat the hulk. superman has beaten the hulk in the marvel vs dc story line. @ apone: uh…hulk’s unbelieveably strong and only gets stronger the madder he gets…? optimus prime defeated from spidey? the vote was not limpid..
1038	here he is thinking of a proposal of love to show elizabeth just how much it has grown and that it is stronger than any objections. too bad his actual words don’t sound as good as they do in his thoughts! exactly! (you always know what i want to say, jakki.

1042	i always think the source material is better, but checking out comic book adaptations, whether tv or film, can be a good way of sampling.
1043	will archie choose betty or veronica?
1044	shopping is probably inevitable for a lot of us. if you or someone you know thinks spider-man is pretty cool but is clueless as to what to read first, i’ve put together a great big list as a checklist or reading order guide.
1045	maybe it’s because there are also about four other comics starring thor or some thor-like character and who can keep them straight?
1046	the villain often uses their brains to become stronger than the hero, or handicap the hero (eg kryptonite island in the superman reboot). the heroes always beat them by using their brains or cunning.
1047	yes, i agree with both of these and whether sartar was a superhero or not or whether that term has any meaning at all, wasn't really my point. my point is... as mentioned by others, who or what is a superhero is a bit of a hulk vs superman debate ...
1048	if superman's strength is a result of the much stronger gravity on krypton, exactly how big was krypton? filled with real scientific evidence, gresh and weinberg's findings will delight and amuse any superman fan.

1054	batman, superman, spider-man, the incredible hulk. even plastic man remains a viable option. each, after all, is unique, offering a child endless possibilities in the way of costumes, superpowers, weapons, vehicles and villains.
1055	the genre is all about who is stronger than who and who is faster or tougher or has the most range with his telepathy and yes, the genre is also about incoherence about power levels from writers to writers!

1058	however, we know when hulk gets madder he gets stronger, and he beats iron man down, then, the end!! great start (but then again so was dc’s wwiii’s start) hopefully, unlike wwiii, world war hulk will keep up the pace.

1060	whatever your dreams or nightmares about enhancement are, at least one member of marvel’s wonder team has got you covered. so which avenger represents you? the hulk represents the monster. the hulk is a man, bruce banner, who becomes enhanced by a massive blast of gamma radiation.
1061	a character with a reasonable dice pool but a pile of pp will dominate a stronger character who doesn't have any. he is so totally not a looser. he has been one of the strongest characters in my home game so far.
1062	wise are those who hasten to the place of rest where angels minister and the holy spirit strengthens. those who allow jesus to share the load are stronger than steel. hell’s most powerful demons cower in fear of those stronger by faith than steel, those who walk and live in the power of the spirit.
1063	the judas contract is just super hero comics at their very best. all-star superman – grant morrison and frank quitely unite to tell quite frankly the greatest superman story of all time. 
1064	as for underground stuff -- who knows? i would say faust is they ever finish the furshlugginer thing. i don't know if hitman will ever have the classic status that preacher has, but it's a shame, because it *is* the better comic.
1065	but he had to accept it and be who he had to be, a very human trait. he had to lead his life with his heart for who he was and all that he did, not to save himself from it. and it made him stronger. and this is where anakin failed. he couldn't accept what had to be, or what could come.
1066	there are just as many which could have been done as stunts but it is hard to say one way or the other. overall, this is not only one of the rare sequels that is better the original.
1067	i've never been a big superman fan. as a kid, i always preferred the more cerebral heroes who didn't punch their way through everything. and back then, superman didn't do much but punch his way through every little thing.
1068	the book has been stronger for it.
1069	your weekend moment of psychic nosebleed zen: deep in the cambodian jungle an evil soviet psychic is attempting to locate the members of team 7 deep within the jungles of cambodia. not only is she unable to find them, but she encounters an unknown telepath — one who is stronger than she is.
1070	jaime is bionically enhanced, which gives her enhanced hearing in her right ear, a stronger right arm, and faster and stronger legs. the character was reintroduced in dynamite’s current “bionic man” series.
1071	it’s easy to forget that many of the superheroes who have repeatedly (albeit fictionally) saved the world are scientists: spider-man (peter parker) is an accomplished science student; the incredible hulk (in his human form, bruce banner) is a nuclear physicist; mr.

1074	in fact, he was probably overdone in his hypermasculinity, save only for the outrageous ultra-muscularity of selected characters like hulk or juggernaut.
1075	from the course catalog: “have you ever wondered if superman could really bend steel bars? would a ‘gamma ray’ accident turn you into the hulk? what is a ‘spidey-sense?’ and just who did think of all these superheroes and their powers?
1076	other early guests included will eisner, jim salicrup, marvel’s editor of the amazing spider-man, peter david, writer of the incredible hulk, and a young todd mcfarlane, who was also working on the hulk.
1077	“marvels” is the book with the stronger emotional impact, but “kingdom come” is all about epic, world-shattering action. i always find myself comparing it to epic, big-budget, widescreen action movies.
1078	but superman renouncing his citizenship is a little more complicated than you or i doing so.
1079	the possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we have to earn it. the hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive consequences, its consuming fire. there’s not a soul on this earth who hasn’t wanted to “hulk smash” something in their lives.
1080	the artist is the highly talented and humanistic penciler gary frank (incredible hulk, action comics). johns and frank had a highly acclaimed run on the first volume of action comics, which saw some truly memorable superman stories be born out of their collaboration.
1081	"i read a hulk comic. it was a standalone issue of hulk gray. i can't remember what number it was, like 334 or something. and i finished reading this story and that was the first time i ever said ""who wrote this comic?"" and i turned to the credits and it said peter david."
1082	this is rob were talking about, if he gives it a c- then someone who wants to go and enjoy this type of flick and doesn't expect much from it would probaby give it a b or b . if anyone sees this in non3d please comment back on how bad the 3d shots are in non 3d.
1083	in the past, the present, or the future, drake shows you we “support our troops.” life is grim and often short for the few who protect the many, usually for little pay, less gratitude, and dim prospects of growing old.
1084	epic is a good descriptor. i do have to go back into the book again cuz i think there were a few scenes that i thought played out stronger in the book as to the movie... (cant say yet as it may be a spoiler) glad i didnt go 3d as ive been burned by 3d a bit too much lately.
1085	the plot is tight and there’s little wasted space or verbiage; the pacing is perfect, down to the issue-by-issue cliffhangers.
1086	some of his pages look great – especially the two-page spread in which zilla vallo contacts superman – but others look very awkward: any page in which a character is grimacing or gasping or shouting or gritting their teeth, and their faces just look deeply unnatural (which means that ultraman always
1087	(and why is he wearing the stupid half-mask for much of the story, when he’s back with his friends in the 30th century, who all know who he is?)
1088	the incredible hulk is tying into the world war hulk storyline by focusing on amadeus cho, the seventh-smartest person in the world, who is also a teenager who believes in the hulk.
1089	the last issue is rife with cheesecake (is this awkward, or is it “okay” because it’s drawn by a woman?)
1090	waid is usually much stronger in his plotting, and not so fuzzy in his themes, so i wonder whether he’s got some master plan for pulling the pieces together and giving them more emotional resonance, or if this is an experimental series for him.
1091	or is the title going to end up not really being relevant to the story?
1092	kaluta is a fine artist, although he could use a stronger inker who works in heavier lines, as his light touch with the blacks tends to get washed out once the pages are colored.
1093	which in a way it is, since there are all sorts of broad hints dropped about the upcoming event blackest night. plus there’s superman prime and sodam yat, who both headed off to appear in legion of 3 worlds, the anti-monitor, and various other nasties running around who pop up later.
1094	kaluta is a fine artist, although he could use a stronger inker who works in heavier lines, as his light touch with the blacks tends to get washed out once the pages are colored.
1095	would it be easier for a new reader to make heads or tails of this book, or harder? i really have no idea. is the story any good?
1096	example: “superman was tagged by solomon grundy, who is slow, therefore superman can be tagged by anyone as fast or faster than grundy.” the person ignores the fact that this could have been a statistical anomaly, and that it doesn’t necessarily hold true all the time.
1097	yea, hulk is pretty pwnzor, but the odds would be exponentially stacked against him. i know!

1111	but the choice and maintenance of potted plants can pose some difficulties. first is the knowledge that particular plants often require very exacting sizes of pots.
1112	the woman at my health food store suggested for the first time that i use one that is plastic and light-weight. apparently the ceramic ones are a little more difficult to maneuver because they’re heavier. in retrospect i don’t think it makes that big a difference.

1115	i’ve done a little research on your behalf to clarify which are safe plastics and which are best avoided. no. 1 plastic is pet, or polyethylene terephthalate.
1116	and containers are portable, so we can move plants around the garden or even indoors for the winter, especially with the help of plant dollies. types are detailed below but there’s one thing they all have in common: the bigger, the better for the health of the plants.
1117	pyrethrum is a commercially grown herb. a chemical is extracted from the daisy type flowers, which is used as an insecticide. it has a good ‘knockdown’ effect on caterpillars, aphids, bugs, thrips, beetles and leaf hoppers and is not residual in the plant or soil.

1119	to be successful at maintaining plant health and vigor, we must choose the correct type and size container and fill with an equally well selected soil mix. there are many types of pots or containers available today ranging from ceramic to plastic.
1120	they openly admitted that the structure of the pans is ceramic and titanium as the sales reps will tell you, while the coating is ptfe (plastic) which emits pfoa (toxic gases) the same as teflon, just a different brand name.
1121	for cooking, it is best to use high-quality glass and ceramic pots which are lead-free or high-quality stainless steel pots. other metals like aluminum, silver, copper, lead, iron, zinc, etc. should be avoided, since they react with food.
1122	a neti pot looks like a miniature version of one of those. a neti pot typically has a small handle on one side and an extended spout on the other. usually these pots are ceramic but i’ve seen glass, steel and even plastic ones in stores.
1123	once you flip that switch in your brain, then the sky is the limit as to what you can do in terms of other exercises that may have a more direct impact on your physique. this is all about building up self-efficacy, which is your situation-specific self-confidence.
1124	in many countries in sub-saharan africa, over 90% of the population cook their food with biomass (plant material). the smoke from such fires can be a nuisance, and it can also lead to severe health problems.
1125	you’ll also want to be careful about the material your container is made of. containers are either porous or nonporous. plastic, glazed ceramic, and dark glass containers are nonporous and hold water better.

1763	frazier and ken norton were my grandmother’s favorite boxers (she thought norton was handsome). my dad loved frazier as well. when i was a kid and into reading sports biographies, he came home with a copy of smokin’ joe: the autobiography of a heavyweight. i read it over and over again.
1764	muhammad ali's toughest opponent from a stylistic standpoint along with joe frazier was undoubtedly ken norton. by parrying ali's jab, utilising his own jab and also employing side to side head movement, norton was able to take away ali's own jab and disrupt his rhythm.

1773	years later ali called joe frazier an uncle tom, too, and a few more people besides smokin' joe found that hard to stomach. patterson was one of a railway labourer's 11 children. frazier came from a dirt-poor south carolina farming family. by comparison, ali's background was comfortable and stable.
1774	that's the difference between muhammad ali and michael jordan. muhammad ali will never die. he used his skill to say something about the social ills of society. of course, he was an excellent boxer, but he got up and spoke on the issues. and because he spoke on the issues, he will never die.
1775	people seem to forget what ali did to joe frazier was far worse than what happened this weekend, that truly was disgusting and a disgrace. i have no axe to grind with ali, but his god like status when it comes to morals in the sport is pathetic lazy journalism.
1776	whether promoting tolerance and understanding, feeding the hungry, studying his religion, or reaching out to children in need, muhammad ali is devoted to making the world a better place for all people. no athlete has ever contributed more to the life of his country, or the world, than muhammad ali.

1780	there was a sweetness to the joe frazier i met years ago. he was, at those moments, struggling financially and unable to let go of his justifiable anger at muhammad ali. he was also proud of the wars he fought and maybe a little bit hurt that some people didn’t remember him more often.
1781	he was by far a talented boxer, i seen him fight once and never heard from him again? although i think a lot of valid points are made in the other responses, here is my 2 cents: marciano beat joe louis (true), but joe was over the hill at that time (what was he, 36 or 38?).
1782	it was joe who inspired sugar ray robinson to box, the younger man tagging along with him to a detroit gym before his family moved to new york. the motor city was some fight town, and nobody graced it better than louis.

1800	frazier took punishment, his face lumpy and swollen, but his constant pressure and two-handed battering proved too much for ali, who was having only his third fight after a three-and-a-half-year layoff. ali fought mostly in spurts, which were often dazzling, but frazier was insistent.
1801	i cannot think of any british heavyweight who could have fought a better, or braver, fight against joe frazier than bugner did that warm july night in 1973.

1810	during ali’s heyday, joe frazier and ali were at the top of the box- ing world. prior to their first fight, both boxers were undefeated. ali was banned from boxing for over three years because of his re- fusal to go into the military when he was drafted.

1819	the bout--which the promoters insisted on calling ali-frazier iv, placing it in the company of three great fights between the protagonists' illustrious fathers, joe frazier and muhammad ali--exemplified most of what was wrong with women's boxing, and also some of its promise.

1821	these days, boxing is so watered down that no-one even knows who is fighting whom anymore. i clearly remember boxing titans clashing; muhammad ali v joe frazier - thrice - and especially the first roberto duran v sugar ray leonard fight. every boxer had one objective: to be no.
1822	i, of course, never did enough boxing ever to be able to answer that question with authority, but i once heard muhammad ali speak of fighting joe frazier and saying, “fighting him was like death.” and i knew what he meant.
1823	exiled from boxing for years for his stance on the vietnam war, muhammad ali, here defeating joe frazier in 1974, personified an era of rebellion and change. even now, making our twenty-first-century rounds, were never far from the reach of the fancy.
1824	however, the appeal of these fights (especially the first one) wasn’t just about the quality of the boxers, it was cultural as well. whether ali or frazier asked for it or not, each fighter served as a symbol for a country divided by the vietnam war.
1825	it was just a few months after his legendary first fight with joe frazier, in which he took a beating and lost to smokin’ joe in what is often called “the fight of the century”. ali took time to sit and talk to me, a jewish kid from the suburbs, and sat me in his lap while he did.
1826	later that year, clay, who was the descendant of a runaway kentucky slave, rejected the name originally given to his family by a slave owner and took the muslim name of muhammad ali.
1827	since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to united artists was small. for stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity -- just like rocky's million-to-one shot with apollo creed.

1829	muhammad ali was beautiful, brash, casually racist, relentlessly libidinous—and, yes, a boxer. billie jean king was “a mind in motion, one of the smartest athletes i’ve known.” lipsyte extols her effect on femininity in sport while barely mentioning the battle of the sexes, which he attended.

1831	just like the “thrilla in manila,” perhaps the greatest boxing match of the 20th century which pitted heavyweight boxers muhammad ali and joe frazier, it was a technical knockout that decided the winner as the terminator, robot of the underdogs of conneaut lake high school, was named champion.

1834	leonard was a good boxer in his own time. there were a coupla other guys in his weight class who were arguably better – tommy hearns, marvin hagler, to name two. nobody – and i mean nobody – lhought there was another fighter as good as sugar ray robinson back in the day.
1835	"""edwin's a highly-ranked super middleweight who can really punch,"" ward remarked. ""a good left hook to the body like his is a great equalizer. for me, it pulled out a few fights that i was losing. edwin's a natural athlete and a humble guy."""

1859	so, my dear android ios crit­ics, i’d love to hear how the “apple way” of doing things can be seen as eas­ier or better. this entry was posted on saturday, december 31st, 2011 at 07:30.
1860	see in use on apple’s iphone 4s, known as siri.
1861	this patent application provides an exception, which is whether or not that page might be considered an “authoritative document.”
1862	apple's new ipad: the screen is better, and it's faster apple just announced the newest ipad, which will be called the ipad, and not the ipad 3 or ipad hd or ipad: eddie bauer edition or with any other modifier.
1863	he said google's clean and simple interface is a better solution to finding all the various files that microsoft creates.
1864	"better yet, the software is ""always on."" you don't have to punch any buttons to activate it, as you do with siri. ordinarily, an ""always on"" speech recognition application is asking for trouble. that's because the software can't determine when you're speaking to it or talking to someone else."

1868	but it's not really google's fault. perhaps each university should assign a librarian to be the chief google officer so she or he could hip faculty to the newest, coolest things.
1869	have you noticed any change -- for better or worse -- in your students' communicative styles and abilities as a result of such technologies? a: are students using the acronyms and emoticons we associate with txting in their academic work? no.
1870	for the latest technology news from inside higher ed, follow ihetech on twitter.
1871	because as much as i’m capable of toying with technology, i’d rather the technology just work. the iphone works. still, there are several area where the iphone does need to improve in order to match or surpass the nexus one. the nexus one’s high-resolution screen is awfully nice.
1872	apple's icloud is more asset based than processing based. icloud is focused less on full-scale “cloud computing” (moving the performance of the apps themselves to the web) than on synching a number of devices with one’s personal data files — which resides in apple’s data center.
1873	google's search engine technology is no longer the weapon of choice for snoopy gubmint or mean-spirited globo corporations. the potential loss of licensing revenue to smarter oem engines with a more esoteric approach, along with the g+ stall, may be forcing brin to go on a charm offensive..
1874	more boot up: google+ -disks, apple's patent poker, the tablet 'slowdown' and more boot up: google kills products, photographing steve jobs, down with word clouds and more boot up: the privacy problem, google's tough path, the 9x email problem, rim's latest woe and more * report errors or inaccuracies
1875	or other changes we make so that your content works better with our services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.
1876	with siri we can see the potential for a better search system than google’s. naturally google could emulate this functionality themselves, but the point is not that it’s beyond their capabilities (they have much of the technology already) but that it disrupts their business model.
1877	some people do not like this, because google’s search engine is used for lots of activities, some of them personal, financial or medical. it is one thing to search for information about, say, a particular ointment.
1878	when htc wants to develop the first lte phone or the first android tablet with pen input, ceo peter chou doesn’t need to call google’s andy rubin and beg for a papal exemption.

1883	the iphone 4 is apple's thinnest smartphone yet, but offers a much better screen, faster processor, video calling, and many other enhancements.
1884	apple has always step forward and do things different, and raise the bar as far as technology. i suspect that the outcome will be improved technology which will benefit all.
1885	now microsoft is fighting back, claiming its products are the most secure — more than google's and apple's. 'when it comes to security, even hackers admit we're doing a better job making our products more secure than anyone else.

1888	so why does everybody still spring for apple's products, even though they're much more expensive than competitors' offerings?
1889	the move is necessitated by the overall lack of support for google's webm video codec, which mozilla and google hoped would replace h.264, the technology backed by apple, microsoft, nokia and other commercial vendors.
1890	they perform useful tasks, such as remembering passwords, or settings on sites users browse often. they are also used by advertisers to track users' viewing habits and to target ads.
1891	but apple’s lack of streaming or being able to play my music in a web browser is a major buzz kill on the product for me. but as the saying goes, to each his (or her) own. let us know if you try any of these out and which one you like the most.
1892	student response systems, or clickers—not unlike gadgets used on television game shows—first appeared in college classrooms over a decade ago and have since spread to just about every college and university in the country, thanks to cheaper and better technology.
1893	and rather than performing a synthetic test, browsingbench performs the same operations which a human would perform on the device.
1894	more importantly, he didn’t need to get his apps only from google’s (or anybody’s) “store”. and if somebody else wants to make a better android phone than this one, they can. and google, i’m sure, hopes they do.
1895	which is quantitatively better for writing great poetry: german or russian? can you really, meaningfully answer that question? apart from all the criticisms, this language has a couple of very strong points going for it.

1900	was designed, created, and deployed to mobile devices running apple’s ios and google’s android os reportedly in just six weeks.
1901	you play search engines and on-line advertising to google's rules, or not at all (almost). yes, it can seems unjust for one company to control a market so totally, however that's commercial reality.
1902	after all, there are cases where lower priced goods actually deliver the same or even better quality than higher priced ones when it comes to fitness for clothing and such, but i think apple would actually make computers which lasted longer and worked better than any of the knockoff folk could manage
1903	screens bring the information to us, which, as i think anyone would agree, is much better than the alternative. despite all this, screens tend to receive a very bad press.
1904	apple's success with the apple iphone has brought with it certain problems. its success has engendered a community that has attempted to circumvent apple's exclusive service agreement with at&t.
1905	x3d has much better html/javascript integration.
1906	but now technology has caught up to the horse race. if you want to win, you better send a tweet. the media giant twitter wasn’t popular enough to be included in the 2008 election cycle.
1907	in addition to mobile phone applications for dictionaries of endangered languages, we think we can probably make downloadable programs for other devices, like ipods, and mobile phones that run android (google’s open-source and free answer to apple’s iphone).
1908	the usual concerns about cloud computing—whether storing data off-premise is secure, and worries about bugs, outages and performance issues over which it departments have no control—also apply.
1909	ian clarke's musings on technology, politics, and life more than once i’ve seen people ask questions like “in a/b testing, how long should you wait before knowing which option is the best?”. we’ve found that the best solution is to avoid a binary question of whether or not to use a variation.

1912	"small teams of two to five members perform better when they include at least one woman. in a study published in science, team performance only weakly correlated with average intelligence of members. but there was a great deal of correlation with the average ""social sensitivity"" of group members."
1913	npr's as a matter of fact posted these drawings of google's book scanner. they developed a system of using two infrared cameras that detect the shape of the page, which allows the ocr software to adjust to better read the text. this is pretty cool.
1914	we’ve been longtime fans of salesforce.com’s fantastic ecosystem of applications, developers, partners, and consultants—known as force.com—and its appexchange (which pre-dated apple’s app store).
1915	i’m sorry, but did all of imagination technologies’ 26 year history got wiped out and only apple is left? and that compares to nvidia’s 18 year history how? what? i’m not claiming apple’s graphic chip design superiority.
1916	we are encouraging our users to create public projects: projects that are open to the public to visit, and which can serve as templates for other users who need to perform similar functions. 
1917	, which themselves seem inherent to technology. for incumbents, competition is a stimulus (which brendan acknowledges) but also a preclusion of tacit knowledge and other resources (which is the issue).
1918	i, for one, am seriously tired of apple's persistent begging for me to upgrade to pro when i launch their player. i am absolutely frustrated with windows media player and its inability to either find a codec or to tell me which flipping codec is missing.
1919	ranger says what apple’s rivals have to develop are devices that are cheaper through focusing on useful applications rather than flash bells & whistles, are able to connect easily with other systems (ipad doesn’t have usb or sd) and support popular software like flash.
1920	"during the presentation, bezos stood in front of an image of apple's white usb cord, which is used to synchronize the data on an iphone, ipad, or ipod with a user's computer. he sneered, ""syncing should be done invisibly, wirelessly, and in the background, and it should actually work."""
1921	well, let me summarize my case in three brief points there are currently only two major mobile app marketplaces, apple's and google's (though windows and amazon will begin to change that).
1922	microsoft on wednesday let consumers start trying out its upcoming touch-based windows 8 operating system, which aims to power a new wave of computer tablets and traditional pcs designed to counter apple's big gains in the market through its macs and ipads.
1923	which platforms perform which functions well, and where do they fall short? this is the unauthorized download of data from a computer to a small device with storage capacity, such as a flash drive, iphone, ipod or other mp3 player. what is it?
1924	mobile managers face a tough choice when weighing which mobile platform or operating system to deploy to mobilize the workforce. there's blackberry, windows mobile, palm os, symbian, linux and j2me. how do they choose? which platforms perform...
1925	"splashpower, another company using inductive technology, has developed their own charging pads, called ""splashpads"" which are malleable... mobile devices: the future of web services?"
1926	i strongly believe that apple’s announcement is the first step in massive changes in how children will learn.
1927	some of the systems and data are going to be free, just as linux, apache and google’s insights, analytics and earth are in the public domain. these offerings make it harder to predict which aspects of the big data system will be profitable.

1931	the star performer for the year was google's personalized start page service igoogle which increased traffic in the 12 months to november by 267.64%.
1932	all of the major booksellers have apps available across mobile operating systems--except for apple's ibooks, which (as you'd expect) is available only on ios.
1933	"or should i say, better yet by far, re-inventing learning & living: ""in blackburn, four-year-olds are making podcasts."
1934	the more apps they have, and the higher quality, the better the platform performs and apple makes more money — consequently end users also benefit from this. i see no reason why apple wouldn’t be a big proponent of web technologies in native apps.
1935	for better or worse (usually worse), these qualities often end up at odds with one another in the current smartphone market, but they make up the measuring stick against which we’re evaluating these devices.
1936	you can also use a resource that google developed for this purpose, howtogomo.com, to make your site look better on a smartphone or a tablet.
1937	julie bohnenkamp, director of technology for center grove community school corporation in greenwood, in, which will pilot an ipad program this summer, concedes that tablet pcs running other operating systems could perform as well as an ipad, but she doubts that the new devices will be able to match the

2540	but there is insufficient evidence to say that high-fructose corn syrup is less healthy than are other types of added sweeteners.

2659	so far so good, so let’s say we have a very large list of data, which we want to sort. obviously it will be better if we divide the list into two sub-lists with equal length and then sort them.
2660	on the plus side, merge sort is a stable sort, parallelizes better, and is more efficient at handling slow-to-access sequential media.
2661	therefore the worstcase running time of quicksort is no better than that of insertion sort. moreover, the (n2) running time occurs when the input array is already completely sorted--a common situation in which insertion sort runs in o
2662	in particular, the average-case analyses of quicksort, bucket sort, and the order-statistic algorithm use probability, which is reviewed in chapter 6.
2663	merge sort is o(n lg n), whereas quicksort is o(n^2). (o(n lg n) is faster). however, these are worst cases; we might find that experimentally one of the algorithms may behave better on average.
2664	however, because the worst case is no longer a natural order it is much more difficult to occur. since mergesort is and selection sort is , there is no debate about which will be better for decent-sized files. but how can we compare two algorithms to see which is faster?
2665	8.2-3 argue that insertion sort is better than quicksort for sorting checks in the best case, quicksort takes . although using median-of-three turns the sorted permutation into the best case, we lose if insertion sort is better on the given data.

2667	well, as insertion sort and bubble sort, shell sort is not very effective compared to quicksort or merge sort. the good thing is that it is quite easy to implement (not easier than insertion sort), but in general it should be avoided for large data sets.

2960	beyond this, cheddar from different parts of the world tastes different because the flavor of the milk varies, the aging time varies and the skill level and techniques of the cheesemakers vary.
2961	we play by the rules, so if it's under 60 days it will be pasteurized milk, but over that two-month mark we've got hundreds of raw-milk offerings, many of which boast a deeper and more complex flavor. q: what does it mean for a cheese to be in (or out of) season?
2962	surprisingly, the united states is the world’s largest cheese producer. but bigger is seldom better or even good. however, not everything we find at the grocery store these days is massed produced.

2966	these dressed up cheeses, pure inventions of the dairy industry, usually come from pasteurized milk and have a standardized taste...
2967	how a given cheese tastes is the result of a number of factors. first and foremost, of course, is the type of milk used: a cow's milk cheese tastes different from a sheep's milk cheese, and a cheese obtained from a combination of water buffalo's milk and goat's milk has its own personality.
2968	and american artisan cheese is getting better and better.
2969	these days, double glouster and cotswold are made in both pasteurized and unpasteurized varieties. like most hard cheeses, this cheese can be stored for at least a month in the refrigerator so you needn't be in a hurry to finish it off, though we suspect you just might after you taste it.

2973	milk and where it can be purchased locally > posted in cheese chicks, author: debra | print | 3 comments » using milk in its unpasteurized state is one of the joys of learning to make cheese at home.
2974	pasteurization does change the flavor of cheeses, and unpasteurized cheeses are often considered to have better flavor, so there are reasons not to pasteurize all cheeses.
2975	they should be promoting the greater interests of cheese rather than this single blinkered view. it’s not to say that all raw milk cheese is good or all pasteurized cheese is bad but a bit of diversity would be good.
2976	the cheese maker does not cook the curds, but to prolong the shelf life of the cheese, it is pressed to expel as much of the whey as possible. cheddar, edam, gouda are examples of cheeses made from this process. * cooked pressed — hard cheese types must be aged far longer than the softer varieties.

2978	raw-milk: the usda requires that all cheese made with raw or unpasteurized milk be aged for at least 60 days to kill any bacteria. cheese made with pasteurized milk, such as kraft singles, does not have to be aged, but its flavor will not change with time.
2979	âthere is no evidence that raw milk is better than pasteurized milkâ we have presented abundant evidence that raw milk is better than pasteurized milk. the attitude of health officials does not take into consideration those individuals who cannot tolerate pasteurized milk but do well on raw milk.
2980	if our cheese tastes different from batch to batch, then we know we are practicing the art of cheese making. taste is subjective, and you may prefer one batch to another, but the cheese will always be great. cheddar cheese is perhaps the most ubiquitous of cheeses.
2981	one percent of the dairy consumed in the united states over that period was unpasteurized, meaning that the rate of raw-milk outbreaks was 150 times greater than the rate of diseases stemming from pasteurized milk, according to the cdc.

2985	public health regulation has done more to extend our lifespans than has medicine. pasteurization does not hurt milk. it is true that goat milk is better than cow milk for infants and adults, but pasteurization will not hurt it.
2986	why does organic milk last so much longer than regular milk?
2987	it does carry a hefty price-tag, but it is so much better for them and tastes a world (in my opinion) better! did you get the full-fat content milk or the two percent? here you can get both in raw milk? the full-content milk will usually taste creamier and richer than pasteurized milk.
2988	but the truth is that there are far more risks from drinking pasteurized milk than unpasteurized milk. raw milk naturally contains healthy bacteria that inhibit the growth of undesirable and dangerous organisms. without these friendly bacteria, pasteurized milk is more susceptible to contamination.
2989	does my body just need to adjust? i don't have access to unpasteurized dairy so i decided to google for sources of butter oil.
2990	lately, we’ve heard a lot of buzz on the virtues of raw milk cheese, but does it really taste better? raw milk cheeses are not pasteurized.
2991	they may think that raw milk provides better nutrition than pasteurized milk. â this is simply not true. â studies have shown that the nutrients in milk are not significantly affected by pasteurization.
2992	can outbreaks be caused by pasteurized milk products? pasteurized milk and cheese products can cause outbreaks, but these are usually due to contamination that occurs after the pasteurization process.
2993	fda's pasteurization requirement also applies to other milk products, with the exception of a few aged cheeses. proponents of drinking raw milk often claim that raw milk is more nutritious than pasteurized milk and that raw milk is inherently antimicrobial, thus making pasteurization unnecessary.
2994	if the lactose in pasteurized cow’s milk gives you an upset stomach, try drinking goat’s milk. you may like it better than lactose-free cow’s milk. goat’s milk does contain lactose, like cow’s milk. but it contains more vitamin a, calcium, potassium and magnesium.
2995	i don’t know about the safety of keeping unpasteurized milk for that long, but i do know it tastes fine for much, much longer than pasteurized. echiré butter as sold for export is pasteurized (as is pretty much all the “premium” butter france exports).
2996	and can i just say, it is true that fresh off the vine veggies taste better than the ones bought at the store. these were no waxy, mealy veggies. the tomatoes were meaty and the green peppers crisp and green tasting.
2997	we did a taste test of the fresh, unpasteurized goat milk and the milk was surprisingly light and not very “goaty” — it tasted almost like skim milk. as it was fresh it needed to first be pasteurized. for pasteurization, you need to keep the milk at 145 degrees for thirty minutes.

3004	i don't know how i feel about unpasteurized milk- something seems not okay with that, but i would like milk (products) where i know the animals were fed and treated well. i think i'm also going to try making my own yogurt- i've heard it tastes better and then i can decide what goes into it.
3005	he does not remember ever getting sick, but says science has never found any evidence that it was more beneficial than pasteurized milk. in fact, he said, raw milk has very little vitamin d, which is added to most pasteurized milk.
3006	the warmer the better. bacteria grow really well between 90-120f. as you can imagine that's a hard temperature to maintain especially in winter. my guess is that my kitchen is at about 65f right now. at that rate, the cream might spoil faster than it ferments. how will you know if it spoils?
3007	some people choose to drink raw milk because they believe it is healthier or tastes better. do not drink raw milk. the fda requires that all milk shipped for interstate sale be pasteurized. in addition, 21 states ban outright the sale of unpasteurized milk.
3008	she also knows that, at least with cheese making, worrying about raw milk does not make sense, considering the microbiology and tradition of cheese making. and the cheese maker she profiles is a great example of the balance of careful practice of microbiology and deep craft of cheese production.

3010	unfortunately for many dairy farmers in the state, new jersey does not allow the sale of unpasteurized milk. if you are interested in raw milk, it is available in parts of california, connecticut, and new mexico. realmilk.org gives a listing of unaltered dairy products including cheese and yogurt.
3011	when tasting beer and cheese together (or any beer and food), the taste of the food and the beer together is more important (and more satisfying) than the the taste of the beer or the food by itself. thus, taste the beer first. describe it. then, taste the cheese. describe it.

3014	we’ve started adding calcium chloride to crisp up our homemade pickles – it’s definitely easier to find than raw milk! these same sources agree that ultra-pasteurized milk (which is all organics, i believe) would not be suitable for cheese-making. organic milk works just fine for cottage cheese.

3059	thanks to the refined technology in our new ge compact fluorescent bulbs, there is now no significant flicker (less than 1 second). however, these bulbs do require a short warm-up period before they reach full brightness, which is why they may appear dim when first turned on.
3060	"""incandescent bulbs return to the cutting edge"". incandescent light bulbs consist of a glass enclosure (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is passed."
3061	the most common type of fluorescent light bulb that consumers use today is the cfl. cfl lamps are a smaller fluorescent bulb that was created to offer the same uses as an incandescent bulb, but with a fraction of the energy used.
3062	compared to other light sources like fluorescent light bulbs and incandescent bulbs, the metal halide light bulb is very efficient, generating 65 -115 lumens per watt, which make them a cost saving and less wasteful option. however, this is not just about saving money.
3063	a compact fluorescent bulb is made to be used just like a traditional incandescent bulb. it will provide the same light, however, by using only about a fourth of the electricity. fluorescent bulbs also emit less heat than incandescent bulbs, and they last as much as 15 times longer.
3064	compact fluorescent light bulbs what consumers need to know compact fluorescent lamps (cfl) are small fluorescent light bulbs that use up to 75 percent less energy than a traditional incandescent bulb and can be screwed into a regular light socket.
3065	prospects dim for the 100-watt incandescent light bulb file - in this may 18, 2011 file photo, a compact fluorescent light bulb is seen in philadelphia. beginning in january 2012, the 100-watt incandescent light bulb will no longer be legally produced in the united states.
3066	incandescent light bulbs — energy drains or symbols of freedom? facing a struggling economy, small businesses are looking around for ways to cut energy costs. using long-lasting, energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs seems like a good idea. right?
3067	however, as the more efficient (using less power to produce the same amount of light) fluorescent bulbs begin to replace it, it is quite possible that the incandescent light bulb will become a thing of the past.
3068	the means edison’s classic incandescent is giving way to more environmentally friendly bulbs, like compact fluorescents (cfls), and leds, which lower energy costs up to 75%.
3069	fluorescent bulbs contain a small quantity of mercury, which is a hazardous substance and requires special handling when the bulbs burn out. light emitting diode bulbs (leds) consume nearly 80% less energy than traditional incandescent.
3070	it's pure b.s. to ban light bulbs. if you dont want people buying them then make a better, cheaper alternative. incandescence is the light produced by a heated object. this light contains billions of frequencies.
3071	led bulbs don't contain mercury, or any toxic substances at all. in that respect, they're definitely better. so that is definitely good news !
3072	light sources for solar and wind energy use: 12/24v dc compact fluorescent lamps, dc camping lantern lights and solar road show lights.
3073	in 1981 thorn introduced the 2d lamp producing 100 watt equivalent light output for 20 watts of power, it is a fluorescent tube folded up into a bulb which contains all the driving circuitry. it has a design life of 5,000 hrs and is priced to give a small economy over tungsten bulbs.

3076	you can reduce that spending by switching from incandescent bulbs to compact fluorescent light (cfl) bulbs. cfls provide the same amount of light as standard incandescent bulbs, but use fewer watts of energy and produce less heat.
3077	q: which wattage of spiral cfl light bulb should i buy to replace my current light bulb? a: the manufacturers of most spiral cfls rate their bulbs for incandescent equivalency. however, there is no agreed upon standard for equivalencies.
3078	the standards themselves, which were developed later, include several exceptions for incandescent light bulbs, including three-way bulbs, colored lights, bug lights or plant lights.
3079	compact fluorescent and led bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered.
3080	as technology races forward, is it time for an i-told-you-so on the “bulb ban”? reports of the death of incandescent lights may be exaggerated.
3081	"the reason is simple, fluorescent light is colder to the eye, therefore less like sunlight. incandescents are warmer and ""feel"" better to people. these halogena bulbs seem a promising compromise."

3084	to clarify, would incandescent be better than halogen? or does the use of a dimmer switch make the halogen just as good, or better, than incandescent, in terms of someone on the mp who is light sensitive?
3085	which type of light bulb is better for the environment? the era of conventional light bulbs, also known as incandescent light bulbs, is about to run out soon. this is because laws are being passed throughout the world to ban these types of light bulbs for more efficient light bulbs.
3086	and what about the people who make these light bulbs…are they protected from the hazards of mercury? what are the trade offs and are they really worth it? my understanding was that the manufacture of cfls is more labor-intensive than traditional bulbs (both incandescent and fluorescent).
3087	either way, the 25% or so of people who really like incandescents should be able to buy them – at roughly the same price as led or cfls (which actually is far cheaper than most media make out.
3088	these can be installed in your hood using a standard incandescent fixture (with foil, mylar or similar to better reflect the light); or for better yet illumination hung pendant style above your aquarium (as is common for reef aquariums). this is not your grandmas power compact bulb!
3089	the alternative to incandescent light bulbs is the cfl, or compact fluorescent, which contains mercury, costs far more and produces light many find unattractive and even unsettling.
3090	compared to incandescent, hologen, or fluorescent lighting, they are better for the environment, use less energy and are in the long run cost efficient as they last so much longer. i think led bulbs are the lighting of the future.
3091	but such led “bulbs” still don’t generate light much brighter than a 35-watt incandescent, which most people consider too little light for reading or other focused tasks.
3092	compact fluorescent light bulbs also come in a variety of color temperatures, which helps determine the color and brightness of the light each bulb provides. (learn more about the brightness, color and light quality of compact fluorescent light bulbs.) none of this is as daunting as it may seem.
3093	the danger comes if the bulbs are cracked, broken or not disposed of properly. although it sounds like a miniscule amount – 4 to 5 milligrams – there is enough mercury in just one fluorescent light bulb to contaminate 6,000 gallons of water.
3094	with just 7 watts of power, you'll be getting ultra bright white led light that's comparable to a 50 watt incandescent bulb.

3097	your article says the fluorescent lamps put out more light energy than the incandescent. that is not true: what is true is that the fluorescent light is in the visible range, so is much more useful to us.
3098	these have a longer life span and use less power than the incandescent bulb for the same amount of light. compact fluorescents radiate a softer white light than that emitted by incandescent bulbs. due to their mercury content, they require proper disposal.
3099	generally, warm white led light bulbs look better in warm environments (earth tones for example) and daylight white led light bulbs look better in cooler environments (blues and stainless steel for example).

3124	this should not be too surprising, because the light from the incandescent comes from a small filament, which is more easily reflected in the same direction than the light from the extended source of the cfl. 
3125	these lamps also differ in that the glass is pinched off where the electrical leads exit the bulb.
3126	"the website, which was developed by yahoo and ""an inconvenient truth"" producer lawrence bender, explains that the bulbs will save consumers $30 or more in electricity over their lifetimes by using 1/3 of the energy of incandescent bulbs."

3148	nevertheless, the quality of this led bulb seems to be better than the cfl and the incandescent, which is not the case for the led spots i have installed at home (the light is quite powerfull but very directed in a narrow angle).
3149	still 15 seconds is an annoying long time, which is why i say that leds are a better (if not entirely available) choice. as for working with electronic switches, i've never heard of this problem...but that is, after all, just one light that still needs to be incandescent.
3150	this development is significant because the energy is emitted directly as white light, so not as much energy is required. i'm going to have to disagree. we haven't always had white light from bulbs. generally incandescent bulbs emit far more yellow light, same with early generations of fluorescent.
3151	mckeag discovered the fluorescent properties of calcium and strontium which doubled the efficiency. peter ranby discovered fluorescent halophosphate in 1950 which when used in a fluorescent tube gives a pure white light.
3152	it is true that compact fluorescent lamps (cfls) can be sensitive to rapid on/off cycling in situations where only brief illumination is required. if you have a light in a closet or somewhere you need to quickly put it on or off, for now it’s better to use an incandescent in that space.

3564	"regulating commerce ""among the several states"" is among the ""enumerated powers"" that the constitution gives congress. i can't say it better than legal scholar charles fried, solicitor general under president ronald reagan, did last week: ""health care is interstate commerce."
3565	obamacare is much less onerous than its opponents claim in other ways, as well. for example, opponents often portray the individual mandate as a new burden that every american will have to bear. in reality, the vast majority of americans either already has or would like to have health insurance.

3567	all the voters really need to know is that romney is against obamacare.
3568	for the government to be able to require that its citizens buy a particular product is for it to have power in the economic realm that is effectively unlimited – and that has never been exercised before. the battle over obamacare is really a fight about freedom.
3569	i think it is really a great topic to write about on my website. also here is some good information if needed: single mom grants well, this site looks way better than my google blog. i think i will use wordpress aswell. what do you think? regards.
3570	but, this whole thing has really drifted from the intent of the article. the issue at hand, of course, is how obamacare is on very dubious grounds constitutionally. i'd take the position that it's wholly unconstitutional and shouldn't even be considered.
3571	"i really want to know why you think one branch of government is more ""legitimate"" than the other. livedlong: how so?"
3572	i like the concept of covering the (any) country's citizens, all of them. one is a more productive person in and for society if they are healthy. pay in to the system while you work, when you're sick you go to the doctor and you get better.
3573	what's striking is the republican alternative. while they scream bloody murder over any effort to constrain costs in medicare, their own plan is to simply end medicare as we know it. the plan approved by the republican house last year would end medicare as a publicly run system.
3574	consider the financial benefit to the economy: insurance companies' overhead (including stupendous salaries for executives and dividends for shareholders) is typically 30 to 40 percent. for medicare, a government program, it's 3 percent -- a much better societal bargain.
3575	"if that weren’t the case, we’d get surprised by the outcomes far more than we do and it would also depend far more on the skill of those arguing the cases rather than the high-level issues at hand. the real reason why roberts does not appear to as ""openly"" commited to overthrowing obamacare."

3579	it is estimated that spending on health care, public and private, has increased 66% faster than without this plan. governor patrick is now talking about rationing care (“manage costs better”). yet the proponents of the plan promised taxpayers that these things would never happen.

3581	my point is not to get congratulations over low blood sugar readings, my point is that without the changes obamacare wrought in my life, my health would have needlessly gotten worse and at some point when i was really really sick, the taxpayers would have wound up paying my bills for the rest of my life
3582	posted by eureka springs on january 31, 2012 at 11:03 am the part of obamacare that is too strong is the $2,000 penalty per employee for companies with more than 50 employees. in essence, every company that profited less than $2,000 per employee, will go bankrupt in 2014.
3583	posted by john geyman md pnhp on july 13, 2010 - 5:29pm the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 (ppaca) is being touted by its proponents as moving the country to near-universal coverage and a great step ahead in u.s. health care. but what does this really mean?
3584	everyone in the world except they know that universal health care is far better than the mess we are in.
3585	the central myth, in not very exaggerated form, is that any care less than the best for anyone is the result of a contrived scarcity. if insurance companies were not so greedy for profit people could have the best care they deserve. 
3586	if obamacare is run like any other government agency, ie. state dept for passports, ice for deporting illegal criminals (sorry for redundancy), the dmv, social security, medicare, and i expect no better from obamacare then my orthopedic surgeon has the right idea.
3587	if any of you bet against obamacare on intrade after reading here, then i am extremely sorry — you’ll know better than to believe me next time. i’ll write a separate post this evening explaining why i was wrong, for those who are interested (and link to it from here). 
3588	letter: is there a better idea than taxing us to death? if the democrat party is so happy to raise taxes on the rest of the country, why not let all of the registered democrats pay for them?
3589	primary recipients of obamacare waivers electric the 'future?'
3590	but if the year-long debate over obamacare has proven anything, it is that americans want no such thing. there is no polling majority or any bipartisan support, much less a rough national consensus, for this expansion of government power.
3591	nobody expects any of them to consider any thing but that what ever came out of the obama administration is is fine. it doing ordering you may be surprised an individual mandate justice sotomayor.
3592	under obamacare the government dictates how health care is delivered-based on the presumption that unelected bureaucrats know better than doctors about patient needs. if they can do that, what's next ? only the dumbest among us will vote for obama.
3593	just to note - the people working to repeal obamacare are fraudulent hucksters with nothing better to do than force the nation to spend more money for healthcare costs than is necessary.
3594	many of these tax increases fall on families making less than $250,000 — a direct violation of candidate obama’s promise not to raise “any form” of taxes on these families. in less than a week, the third anniversary of obamacare being signed into law will take place.
3595	"to them, any ""government"" is too big and any tax is too high. they will not be happy until every fda inspector, sec auditor and irs agent is laid off so they can't bother their fat cat overlords."
3596	this is the true ‘bomb' contained in obamacare and the one item that will have more impact on the future of how medical care is paid for in this country than anything we've seen in quite some time.
3597	this is dirty secret no. 4 in obamacare that our government isn’t telling you: obamacare is ultimately designed to force retiring baby boomers into a much cheaper version of socialized medicine than medicare, which is already being positioned to be cut to the tune of $500 billion.
3598	because of obamacare…they (ins. co.) are cutting back on services already…because they go by medicare standards…they know obamacare is taking $500b or more, out of medicare to fund obamacare. we are already suffering not getting the care we need because of this outragious law. it must be repealed.
3599	moffit shows in his research that the fehbp has outperformed medicare in every dimension of performance: “it has better benefits, better service, catastrophic limits on what enrollees must pay, and far better premium cost control.”
3600	consider what is going to happen if we fail . . posted in a renewed conservatism, obamacare nightmares | 1 comment » gotta luv these folks — they sure know how to party! i can’t say it any better than ace: that image just gets people where they live.
3601	hugh hewitt is asking, “do you think dean barnett is smiling?” well, i bet he is. hugh then puts brown’s win into sharp focus: the voters knew exactly what was on the line and they voted, decisively, against obamacare. “it will raise taxes. it will hurt medicare. it will destroy jobs.
3602	under his plan to cut medicare by $267 billion, drug providers would have to pay medicare rebates like they currently pay to medicaid.” “maybe you are better off not having the surgery but taking, uh, the pain pill.”
3603	that is my (somewhat contrarian) position on medicare and medicaid.
3604	what’s really funny is that elana kagan while she was solicitor general told the formers of obamacare how to defend it. now that’s funny.
3605	a challenge to obamacare does not have a snowball’s chance in hell’s kitchen. resistance is futile. listen to your betters and obey.
3606	“if, for example, the cooperative idea that kent conrad has put forward, if that is a better way to reduce costs and help families and businesses with their health care, i’m more than happy to accept those good ideas.”
3607	"he has said that ""if obamacare is actually implemented,"" then ""america as we know it will be no more."" today, after he announced his candidacy, santorum declared that american troops at d-day had been fighting for rep. paul ryan's plan to effectively end medicare."
3608	"the hard-wired message says simply, ""please repeal obamacare."" uncertainty over what obamacare will really cost companies is probably the major reason they're reluctant to hire new people. repeal obamacare quickly, and this uncertainty will disappear."
3609	drew altman, chief executive officer of the kaiser family foundation, said it better than i’ve seen or heard anyone else put it: “there’s an old adage in politics: benefits once conferred are almost impossible to take away.” the supreme court’s decision is expected before july of this year.
3610	good during the healthcare debacle b/c the mandate is the primary reason it's unconstitutional well, it was really a necessity, however you spin it, even if it also made it unpopular.
3611	at 5:36 into this video richard epstein (uchicagolaw colleague of obama) calls the legal challenge to obamacare better than what had been thought. note that the interview occurred before today’s court ruling.
3612	the kind interpretation is that the justices don’t know how the health care market works any better than most reporters do, so they’re grasping for ways to understand it.
3613	the kind interpretation is that the justices don’t know how the health care market works any better than most reporters do, so they’re grasping for ways to understand it.
3614	the kind interpretation is that the justices don’t know how the health care market works any better than most reporters do, so they’re grasping for ways to understand it.
3615	the intent is to bring us to our knees. and healthcare is the place to make the largest headway. more than 75% of this country is against obamacare because we know where it leads.  i want the gop to “stand up” for this country. if the supreme court does not find this monster unconstitutional.
3616	here's the catch, medicare premiums will most likely be hiked and nullify most, if not all, of any increase in your social security checks. now how much the medicare premiums will go up is not yet known and won't be known for weeks.
3617	is obamacare in trouble?
3618	when uncle sam is footing the bill for americans’ healthcare, they’d better do as he says or else.
3619	any talk by liberals about masscare and obamacare being identiacal is purely political and is wholey disingenuous. come on, does anyone really think the libs would be giving romney any credit at all if they didn't think it would hurt him?
3620	the problem is beyond the fact that medical cost growth is faster than that of any other part of the economy. our problem is also demographic. our population is aging and as we age, medical expenses grow. today, 12 percent of the population is 65 or older.
3621	this panel has very little over site on it and they will be more interested in money than in our healthcare. there are better answers to improve healthcare that is affordable. the first one is for congress to repay all the iou’s to ss and medicare.
3622	this is a better option than having a whole family with no coverage. consider a high-risk pool – these carriers typically cannot deny you due to a health problem.
3623	“the medicare advantage program is stronger than ever,” said secretary sebelius. 
3624	so why are the elderly doing over fifty times better than the young when they were only doing ten times better before? older people vote in droves.
3625	for many, the payroll tax bite is larger than the income tax.
3626	but the left insis donald berwick is smarter than you. he didn’t say so, although he really did. instead, berwick implied as much in his own rather tweed blazer and tote bag-style fashion. 
3627	one of the provisions in obamacare that has received the most media attention is the mandate that insurance policies be offered to individuals with preexisting conditions at any time.
3628	is this what all seniors are to expect from obumbacare? no care! even those on death row in prison get better care than seniors. illegals get better care as they go to emergency rooms at taxpayer expense.
3629	one.........the uneducated who really don't know any better and truly believe that president obama is a socialist based upon right-wing propaganda and two..........the educated who do know better but feed the political fugue and stupidity because they hate our present president.
3630	"the holtz-eakin study says premiums would go up by 20 percent if ""applied evenly across the medicare population."" and the study is less dire-sounding than the ads."
3631	the american economy deserves better than current regulatory and tax policies a friend and i were talking today about just how difficult it will be to explain current memes to future generations. by and large this is a problem that past generations really didn’t have to deal with.
3632	peer review” is really ”physician peer review fraud”.
3633	“obamacare”), the big hospital lobby finally succeeded. obamacare prevents any physician-owned specialty hospitals built after 2010 from treating medicare patients.
3634	it sounds a bit naive i know, but isn't that better than having to keep correcting the goofs in post?

3638	but like i said, not any that would support what you already want to believe. however, if you would like to refute what they have to say give it a whirl, that’s why i put the link up. actually, tpm’s data doesn’t really paint obamacare in a good light.
3639	and, as one of the medicare trustees has just made clear, if you don't double count the $575 billion set aside for the medicare trust fund, obamacare adds to the already crushing national debt. three years later, we are back to smoke and mirrors.

3652	even if the court's word is based on law more than policy, it would qualify. and what if the court upholds the aca? the ruling would be a rallying cry for conservatives and a boon to right-wing turnout in november. obamacare is an unpopular piece of legislation, and has been one from the start.

3987	several experiments showed that the three common methods used to construct multiple classifiers from the same training data -bagging, boosting and randomized trees (random forests)- produce mutually weakly dependent trees.
3988	random forests use simple majority voting to combine the predictions of the trees. however, it is clear that each decision tree in a random forest may have different contribution in classifying a certain instance.

4017	while the accuracy of this classifier is quite poor, combinations of spatial and k-nn or tree classifiers are substantially better than any of the constituent classifiers.
4018	decision tree fields (dtfs) are a new model that combines and generalizes random forests and conditional random fields (crf). the key idea is to have a very large number of potential functions which are all based on non-parametric decision trees.

4030	machine learning methods are used to design the models, including gaussian mixture models, support vector machines, and random forest classifiers.
4031	more generally, accuracy assessments that are based on cross-validation, or that are from a random split of the total data into training and test data, are realistic only if the processes that generated the data are the same processes that will apply when results are put to practical use.

4044	in fraud, for example, a model that might identify too many false positives is probably better than a model that identifies too many false negatives (because we then miss too many real frauds). the default loss for each case is 1--they are all of equal impact or loss.
4045	perhaps an even better story is that with half of the resources currently deployed on investigations (i.e., a caseload of 50%), with our model we could recover almost 90% of the frauds and marginally more than 90% of the dollars known to be recoverable.

4821	"but, now-a-days i'm trying to learn ""r"", which of course is excellent for any statistical related work. it has a steep learning curve however."
4822	i believe that a course in r should be obligatory for all students that are likely to come close to any data analysis in their careers.
4823	at this year's conference, i learned about other free (or at least inexpensive) tools for data analysis and presentation. want to see all the tools from last year and 2012? for quick reference, check out our chart listing all 30 free data visualization and analysis tools.
4824	i consider it as a draft, but it should already be of interest for some of you. posted in python | tagged python, rest, sphinx | leave a comment python is a script language that has evolved into a “do whatever you want”.
4825	since many observers do not see the unprocessed data or realize that it is accessible without great effort, this lecture will concentrate on this lower data level. because i know the gbt best i will draw most of my examples from this telescope.
4826	if you have rpy installed and the vegan package installed, you should be able to just run this python script. often-run analyses that you need r for can be wrapped in a class or module to encapsulate your data analysis needs, so you don’t need to clutter your code with it.
4827	david pierce has contributed the ncdf4 package for reading netcdf data into r and for creating new netcdf dimensions, variables, and files, or manipulating existing netcdf files from r.
4828	i also know a python programmer (python and sql actually) who does much of his work at the interactive interpreter - he likes to suck data in, transform it, push it back out and then walk away.
4829	r is a great software environment for statistical computing and generating plots. if you are building models or doing data mining then you should know about this project. r includes its own programming language and a number of high-quality analysis packages.
4830	for example, if you were very careful, you could use a felt tip pen to assign an ordinal index to each of the twelve eggs contained in a carton containing a dozen eggs. (should you start with zero or one?)

4832	python scripts that open files from various sources should use this mode in conjunction with ‘r’,’w’, or ‘a’ to gracefully handle the different possible newline characters. after a file is open, data can be read from a file in a number of ways and through various methods. 
4833	the purpose of this document is to provide an overview of a typical processing pathway for the analysis of fmri data with afni software. throughout i emphasize the commands that are used to process data.
4834	. so here it of no use how ever i have tried the opening mode 'a' or 'a+' here the truncating file should happen.
4835	(note that i am only discussing ease of use for statistical analysis and data management necessary to do that analysis). personally, i have found and continue to find sas much easier to learn. there may be several reasons for this. first, i learned sas before i learned r.
4836	"see python library reference: 4.2.1 regular expression syntax for more. because of the use of backslashes in patterns, you are usually better off defining regular expressions with raw strings, e.g. r""abc"". when a regular expression is to be used more than once, you should consider compiling it."

4842	i still strongly believe that the first course in computing should not be a course in software engineering. students should not have to learn the discipline of creating code for others, while just starting to make sense of the big ideas of computing. 
4843	being a python person myself, i think the best low-level language to be proficient for me is c. many other high-level languages have c interfaces. so investing the time to learn c should pay off one way or the other. aren’t we doing a lot of web programming these days?
4844	if you are a data analyst, business or information technology professional, student, educator, researcher, or anyone else who wants to learn to analyze the data effectively then this book is for you. no prior experience with r is necessary.
4845	shaping raw data into the appropriate input file for analysis via mark, capture, and other programs can be time consuming and fussy. it is often useful to write a short program to do this automatically, especially when more than one (or one very complex) input file is required.
4846	for example, a molecule's mass depends on its composition. the older drone code maintained these dependencies manually with a set of 'if' statements that specified which prediction routines should be called, and in which order, during execution of an analysis.
4847	we are looking for talented and passionate software engineers to design and build our data management systems, develop advanced analysis tools to leverage this data for agricultural management, and create web-based front-ends for data analysis and visualization.
4848	i have a macbook that runs windows 7. i have the basic car suite (excel/access, arcgis, spss, etc.) but also plenty of open-source tools, such as r for visualization or mysql/postgres for databases. i use coda and text mate for coding. i use bbedit and python for text manipulation.
4849	r is beautiful for interactive data analysis, and its open library of statistical packages is amazing. however, the language design can be unnatural, and even maddening, for larger development projects.
4850	at this year's conference, i learned about other free (or at least inexpensive) tools for data analysis and presentation. want to see all the tools from last year and 2012? for quick reference, check out our chart listing all 30 free data visualization and analysis tools.
4851	i don’t have exact numbers, but for “historical reasons”, a non-python file containing base64 encoded data was given a .py extension. when excluding this file from the line count, around half a million lines of actual python code exist, and about a quarter of these are tests.
4852	for a number of years i did quite a lot of teaching — computer systems analysis and design, and also data modeling and database design. during the classes the students and i constructed a lot of diagrams of various kinds.
4853	in analyzing and building up the grammar/structure of the text for python, i opted for line by line analysis and coding. i think this brings clarity and is easier to read.
4854	statistics with r – part 1: an old dog learns new computing tricks when doing math or numerical analysis, the knowledge of the technique is far too often tied to the tool performing the calculation. 
4855	we found one implementation of dot distribution in python, which we extended into a module for reuse. englewood (named after an ailing chicago neighborhood that the newspaper writes many sad stories about) uses the python bindings for gdal to load data from postgis or shapefile.

4871	the base should be independent of the implementation, like python does with text: utf-8 for files and ucs-4 in memory.
4872	"debian 2.1 users should be able to just type ""apt-get install python"", and python 1.5.x is included with redhat 5.0 or higher and can be installed with glint. using your favorite text editor (i like vim), pull up a chair and follow along!"
4873	i do plenty of genomic data mining with python. i need the statistical functions of r but unfortunately r is a pain to learn and work with. i still dont understand its data structures, also its script is archaic. i will definitely look into rpy2.
4874	you should also become familiar with the user interface of esri arcgis desktop, the industry-leading gis software package for which virginia tech has a site license. you should be able to develop a basic map using example data sources and perform basic spatial analysis.

4879	qualified students should apply to attend the 2012 open science grid user school, where they will learn how to use high-throughput computing to harness vast amounts of computing power for research. send an email to ci-info@listserv.uark.edu or subscribe to the rss feed.
4880	so suppose you are not a statistician but belong to some other data analysis culture, data mining, for example, and you want to learn r. well, like any of the world’s great natural languages r approachable from many different starting points.
